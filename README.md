### Hi there 👋

👨🏻‍🎓 I've just completed the taught modules from a HDip in Data Analytics at GMIT (Galway Mayo Institute of Technology) and am just waiting to complete a placement. Most of the work here is part of projects and coursework from those studies.

🥸 While looking for a job I'm keeping in touch with short LinkedIn Learning courses so most of the recent work is from those.

🌱 Haven't decided what area I want to specialise in yet so having a go at everything!

🎹🎻🎼 Been a professional musician for the past 25 years so all of this new and exciting!
